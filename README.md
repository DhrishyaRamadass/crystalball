We formed our group based on our common interests of speculative visualisation, artificial intelligence and the use of virtual spaces. 

We wanted to introduce innovation into the sector of urban public policy and civic engagement by allowing for a framework where the public can 

1. Visualise the effects of said policy on a slice of the city
2. can engage and interact in a way to submit ideas and feedback

Physical? if the why is ‘because it is a deliverable’, not good enough. Think again.

## What we did: 

1. Train a Model -**Policy Implementation Simulation**

Our project focuses on four pivotal policies aimed at fostering sustainability and resilience in urban landscapes by the year 2050. Employ the trained GPT model to generate speculative scenarios illustrating the implementation of the four policies within the selected urban areas. The model extrapolates potential changes in infrastructure, energy usage, transportation systems, and overall urban morphology. Image descriptions, text descriptions of the changes that can be visualised, affected sectors and image generations for 2050. We trained the model with Foresight and the steps and process to implement following policies.

1. Circular Economy: Implementing strategies to minimize waste generation and maximize resource efficiency through closed-loop systems.
2. Carbon Neutrality: Transitioning towards energy sources and practices that eliminate or offset carbon emissions, thereby mitigating climate change.
3. Building Renovation for Energy Efficiency: Retrofitting existing structures to enhance energy performance and reduce environmental impact.
4. Sustainable Urban Life and Green & Smart Mobility: Promoting eco-friendly transportation modes and sustainable living practices to enhance the quality of life in urban areas.

2. Identify areas that will be affected by these policies the most. eg. fuel pumps, urban living

3. Generate outputs with Dall-E from OpenAI. The output images all looked similar

We also got some interesting results using Image to Image Generators that were not from OpenAI to create outputs that don’t all use the same imagery to represent changes.

4. 3D asset generations for building virtual spaces 

We explored different ways to prompt to generate a 3D model or a Python code for Blender/ Geasshopper

5. Another output we wanted to generate was HDRIs. We tried generating panaromic images and also creating 360 images. This required. lot of post processing done by humans (Jorge) to be usable

Most of the time was spent finding different ways to prompt and generate the output we wanted with the simplest steps

## Exhibition Ideas:

Interactive Displays: Set up interactive screens where visitors can navigate the future cityscapes, exploring different areas and learning about the changes through pop-up descriptions or audio guides.
Physical Model Display: Exhibit the 3D printed models alongside the corresponding current-day photographs and descriptions, providing a stark visual contrast.
Virtual Reality Tour: Offer a VR tour where participants can virtually walk through the future cityscapes, experiencing the transformations firsthand.
Policy Impact Stations: Create stations focusing on each policy, showing before-and-after scenarios, potential benefits, and challenges.
Feedback Station: Include an interactive feedback station where visitors can leave their thoughts on the visualizations or suggest additional policies for future simulations.


##Utilization for the Future:

Urban Planning Tool: Provide the tool to urban planners and policymakers as a visualization aid to foresee the impacts of their decisions.
Educational Resource: Use the project in educational settings to teach students about sustainable urban development and the importance of forward-thinking policies.
Public Engagement: Use the exhibit to engage the public in discussions about future urban environments, collecting their input and raising awareness about sustainable development.
