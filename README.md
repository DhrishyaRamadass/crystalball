## Ideation 

We formed our group based on our common interests of speculative visualisation, artificial intelligence and the use of virtual spaces. 

We wanted to introduce innovation into the sector of urban public policy and civic engagement by allowing for a framework where the public can 

1. Visualise the effects of said policy on a slice of the city
2. can engage and interact in a way to submit ideas and feedback

Physical? if the why is ‘because it is a deliverable’, not good enough. Think again.

In response to the pressing global challenge of climate change and the imperative to transition towards sustainable living, the project aims to leverage advanced technologies to envision and communicate the potential impact of key policies on urban environments. By integrating the EU’s Public Policy recommendations with GPT by training a model, we aim to create a dynamic and visually compelling representation of a sustainable future for cities in the European Union (EU).

Our project focuses on four pivotal policies aimed at fostering sustainability and resilience in urban landscapes by the year 2050:

1. Circular Economy: Implementing strategies to minimize waste generation and maximize resource efficiency through closed-loop systems.
2. Carbon Neutrality: Transitioning towards energy sources and practices that eliminate or offset carbon emissions, thereby mitigating climate change.
3. Building Renovation for Energy Efficiency: Retrofitting existing structures to enhance energy performance and reduce environmental impact.
4. Sustainable Urban Life and Green & Smart Mobility: Promoting eco-friendly transportation modes and sustainable living practices to enhance the quality of life in urban areas.

**Process:**

1. **Data Acquisition and Preprocessing:** Begin by collecting 3D scans of urban areas within the EU, ensuring diversity in size, location, and characteristics. These scans serve as the foundational data for our modeling endeavor.
2. **GPT Training:** Utilize GPT-based algorithms to train a model on the specified policies and their potential effects on urban environments. This training phase involves feeding the model with relevant textual data, including policy documents, research papers, and expert opinions.
3. **Policy Implementation Simulation:** Employ the trained GPT model to generate speculative scenarios illustrating the implementation of the four policies within the selected urban areas. The model extrapolates potential changes in infrastructure, energy usage, transportation systems, and overall urban morphology. Image descriptions, text descriptions of the changes that can be visualised, affected sectors and image generations for 2050
4. **3D Visualization in Grasshopper/ Blender:** Develop Python scripts that interface with Grasshopper, a parametric design tool, to translate the GPT-generated scenarios into 3D models. These models dynamically represent the hypothetical future states of the urban landscapes, incorporating elements such as green spaces, renewable energy infrastructure, and optimized transportation networks.
5. **Physical Output and Communication:** 3D print the generated models to materialize the speculative visions of sustainable urban development. These physical artifacts serve as tangible representations of the potential impacts of the policy interventions and facilitate public engagement and discourse on urban sustainability.

**Conclusion:**
Through the  integration of GPT-based generation and 3D modeling techniques, the project offers a novel approach to envisioning and communicating the future of urban sustainability. By visualizing the potential effects of key policies, we aim to inspire the public to be more of a collaborative entity in policy building, and stakeholders and decision-makers to embrace transformative strategies that will foster greener, more resilient, and livable cities in the EU and beyond.
